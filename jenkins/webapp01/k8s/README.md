# Kubernetes Environments

The directories here represent your various K8s environments, such as Staging and Production clusters.

You may choose an arbitrary application tag/version to deploy into any of these environments by
setting `CODE_VERSION=MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in the `environment_name/.env` file.
